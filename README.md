# starboundmodtester
Starbound Mod Tester is a simple way for Starbound mod developers to make quick changes to mods and easily test them out.

The script takes the name of a directory, builds a mod using that directory, inserts the mod into Starbound, and starts Starbound.
This removes all the hassle of going to pack the mod yourself and adding it in. Now, you can do it with just one press of a button!

This version is for Linux only. Anyone who wishes to make a Windows/macOS branch may do so, as I have no knowledge or intention of doing so.

NOTE: The mod does NOT load Starbound through Steam, so all Workshop mods will not be loaded. However, this does allow for usage on platforms other than Steam, such as GOG.
